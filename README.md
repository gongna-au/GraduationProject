# GraduationProject

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Graduation Project! This project is a comprehensive system designed to address a specific need, integrating modern web technologies and advanced algorithms for a seamless and efficient user experience. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, including its architecture, how to set it up, and how to use it.

## Project Overview

This Graduation Project aims to  "improve the efficiency of parking space utilization in urban areas through a smart parking system". The project is built using Vue.js for the frontend, Go (Golang) for the backend, and Python for running specific algorithms.

## Technologies Used

Frontend: Vue.js
Backend: Go (Golang)
Algorithms: Python
Database:  MySQL

Other Technologies: [Any other significant technologies used in the project, e.g., Docker for containerization, Kafka for messaging]

### Features

### Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (for Vue.js)
Go (for the backend server)
Python (for running algorithms)
[Any other prerequisites]
Setting Up the Project

#### Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone [repository URL]
cd [project name]
```

#### Frontend setup:
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
```bash
